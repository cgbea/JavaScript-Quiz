## Credits
The project brief and starter code was provided by edX as part of its Skills for Life front-end skills course. Javacript lessons from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) and [mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) were used in the making of this project. The YouTuber James Q Quickly's video [Build A Quiz App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfOv18lCMmw) was a particularly useful source of information and relevant syntax.
